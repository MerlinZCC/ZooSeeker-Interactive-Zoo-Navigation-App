# Workplan for the week of 5/12-5/18

### For this week we are assigning tasks and beginning a code sprint, this sprint will entail UI refinement before feature addition, and the creation and input of our visual map

The user stories we will focus on for this sprint are as follows:
- 2
  - Visual Map implementation
  - Map section UI creation
  - Database expansion for map features
- 11
  - Visual refinement of direction page
- 12
  - Plan page UI improvements
    - Touched up overall page
    - Touched up exhibit add page
- 13
  - Design plan for detail page
    - Live animal section
    - Description
    - Pictures
- 14
  - General UI design
    - Overall colors
    - UI features outside of others stories such as bottom bar

We were to focused on implementing features that we realized we did not have user stories that covered our UI implementations that would accomodate the user stories. 

Each user story will be accompanied by an initial figma design; UI will be developed in XML; we are currently choosing a database that we can make calls to in the development of a more live service platform in the anticipation of live features such as exhibit closures and animal statuses.

Our milestone for this section is the creation of the map section with scrollable and clickable map, plan section with same features but cleaned up look, direction section with same features but cleaned up look
