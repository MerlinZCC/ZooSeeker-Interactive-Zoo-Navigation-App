# Workplan for the week of 5/26-6/1

### For this week, we are continuing to work on the backlogged user stories as well as grading our minal and our critiqe presentation for the enemy team minal

Our presentation from last week went very well and we are very happy to continue moving forward! We have made additional issues regarding documentation and testing and are actively working on those parts of the project. Unfortunately we did get sidetracked with reading the SWEBOK document to come up with questions for the minal and finalizing a war binder to use during the testing time. This did take considerable time as we had never made a test before. However we were able to update our database more, adding the possibility for show times, image links, and animal descriptions. The visual map received updates for animal specific medallions to add details, and work has been done on a filter for the map.

We have reemphasized some of our user stories and made sure they were accurately assign. User story 11 is now underway officially and we are working on reassigning User story 12 as the original assignees are still working on what they were assigned for User Story 2. 

We are currently:
- Working on US11
- Reasssigning US12
- Continuing to make database updates
- Continuing Documentation
- Continuing Testing Implementation
