# Workplan for the week of 4/28-5/4

### For this week, we wanted to make out the potential features that we could add, as well as our overall mission for the project

After decided upon the version of ZooSeeker developed initially by team member Zach, we wanted to note down the changes we believed we could make. A few of them are as follows:

1. Events like animal talks
2. Animal descriptions and pictures in the planner
3. Login system
4. Tutorial
5. Chat bots
6. Accessibility features
7. Exhibit recommendation via AI
8. Interactive zoo map
9. Real Zoo Data
10. Better UI
11. Android device consistency
12. Animal exhibit status
13. Visual path
14. Events list

We wanted to have a driving mission statement that we could reflect back to in determining what our application should look and feel like. What we produced was that our mission was **To make your visit to the zoo simple, informative, and fun!**
