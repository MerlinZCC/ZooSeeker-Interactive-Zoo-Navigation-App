# Workplan for week of 6/2-6/9

### For this week we are initiating wrap up and planning our branch merges to have a 'complete' repo by 6/9 at 11:59 PM

After presenting our minal grading and critiques our last goal is to be as complete as we can before merging for the final product. Grading and critiqing went very smoothly and nothing went wrong with the presentation. We are still working on everything from the previous workplan but we've made progress in several areas. The database is essentially complete, the map filtering is functioning appropriately, and the detail pages are being linked in the proper locations. 

We are aiming to be complete with all of our remaining feature tickets so that we can start merging Friday morning. We plan to be active and participating together for the duration of the merge as since each person worked on different aspects, different elements need to be merged from different places. From there we will be using the remaining time after final submission to finalize documentation and script our 6 minute presentation and live demo.

Overall we are very pleased with where we're at. This is obviously not where we thought we would be, but we have made substantial progress towards a lot of our goals and we are happy to present where we are.
