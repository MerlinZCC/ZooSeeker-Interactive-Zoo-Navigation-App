# Workplan for the week of 5/19-5/25

### For this week we will be assigning cleanup, testing, and documentation tasks to help solidify the progress that was made over the last sprint

Of the user stories that were assigned (2,11,12,13,14) we made significant progress on both 2 and 13 in terms of UI and database for both. Unfortunately we misjudged the time it would take for the user story tasks and quite a few issues slipped through. These issues were mainly related to further improvement of old items and these were neglected in favor of new features.

However 2 and 13 are almost fully completed with the features that were proposed to be implemented including a new map design, feature funcitonality and app flow paths.

For this week we will continue with these same stories but as 2 and 13 are able to wind down, we will focus more on the UI cleanup that was intended with 11, 12, and 14.

We will present on our current changes on 5/20 to the class highlighting the following:

What’s going well
- Map Design
- Exhibit Detail
- Visual Map
- Database move

What’s not going well
- Amount of work
- Previous cleanup
- Pipeline
- Some documentation

What we’re looking at moving forward
- Cleanup sprint
- Pipeline solidification
- Documentation solidification

Our tasks for this week will include more documentation, and setting up of the currently unimpressive CI/CD pipeline.
